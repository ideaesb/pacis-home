<p>The Pacific Climate Information System (PaCIS) provides a programmatic framework to bring together ongoing and future climate observations, operational forecasting services and climate projections, research, assessment, data management, outreach, and education - an integrated system of climate services -  to address the needs of the Pacific Islands.  It provides a forum for sharing the expertise, experience, and perspective needed to guide integrated program planning and product development.</p>
