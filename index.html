<p>The Pacific Climate Information System (PaCIS) provides a programmatic framework to bring together ongoing and future climate observations, operational forecasting services and climate projections, research, assessment, data management, outreach, and education - an integrated system of climate services -  to address the needs of the Pacific Islands.  It provides a forum for sharing the expertise, experience, and perspective needed to guide integrated program planning and product development.</p>

<p><b><span style="font-size: larger">Activities recently completed or currently under way:</span></b></p>

<ul>
 <li>A NEW Pacific Islands Climate <a href="http://www.pacificcis.org/outlooks" target="_blank">Outlooks Catalog</a>. This website facilitates access to a broad range of information related to climate variability in the Pacific Islands.  Users can search, by region and/or climate variable for example, and find a list of relevant products along with a brief summary and a direct link to each.</li>
 <li>A NEW quarterly Hawaii and Pacific Islands Climate and Impacts and <a href="docs/Pacific%20Region%20Quarterly%20Climate%20Impacts%20and%20Outlook%20_Sep%202012%20DRAFT.pdf" target="_blank">Outlook &quot;one-pager&quot;</a>.  This prototype product draws on the PEAC Climate Center’s <a href="http://www.prh.noaa.gov/peac/update.php" target="_blank">&quot;Pacific ENSO Update&quot;</a> quarterly newsletter and other sources to bring together seasonal predictions and projections information alongside recent impacts of weather and climate events in a concise and accessible format.
 <li>Updates and additions to <a href="http://www.pacificislandsclimate.org/" target="_blank">PacificIslandsClimate.org</a> (a.k.a. 'piko'). This website is a gateway to a broad range of information related to climate in the Pacific Islands. It includes summaries of programs, projects, and activities, as well as products and services.  The addition the Adaptation Partnership’s Pacific chapter review of planned and existing adaptation activities are part of this effort.  These reviews provide an inventory of regional and country-level adaptation activities and a summary of key adaptation priorities, based on documents like the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change's National Adaptation Programs of Action and National Communications. </li>
 <li>
 
 <p>Continuation of activities associated with the Pacific Islands Regional Climate Assessment (<a href="http://www.pacificrisa.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=265&Itemid=180" title="Pacific Islands Regional Climate Assessment" target="_blank">PIRCA</a>), a collaborative effort aimed at assessing the state of climate knowledge, impacts, and adaptive capacity in Hawaii and the US-Affiliated Pacific Islands.</p>
 <p><b>COMING SOON:</b>  The PIRCA report <a href="http://www.pacificrisa.org/cms/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=30" title="RISA Publications" target="_blank">&quot;Climate Change and Pacific Islands: Indicators and Impacts&quot;</a>.  Prepared in support of the USGCRP National Climate Assessment, this document reviews the state of climate knowledge, impacts, and adaptive capacity in the US-affiliated Pacific Islands.</p>
 <p><b>HOLD THE DATES:</b> The PIRCA in collaboration with other regional partners is supporting workshops to facilitate a iterative dialog among local experts, key decision makers, and scientists to ensure that science and services are appropriately and effectively brought to bear on relevant problems and questions.</p>
 <p><b>Hawaii</b>: <a href="javascript:alert('Agenda TBD');">Dec 10-12, 2012</a></p>
 <p><b>Fiji</b>: <a href="javascript:alert('Agenda TBD');">January 21-25, 2013</a></p>
Guam: TBD
 </li>
 <li>Updates to <a href="http://www.pacificstormsclimatology.org/" target="_blank">Pacific Storms Climatology Products</a>, a developmental website that provides access to an integrated suite of products that delineate patterns and trends of storm frequency and intensity - "storminess" - within the Pacific.</li>
